## v0.2.0 - 2025-04-01

[compare changes](https://github.com/indaco/goaster/compare/v0.1.2...v0.2.0)

This release brings several enhancements that improve developer experience, streamline integration, and lay the groundwork for more maintainable usage.

### ‚ú® Highlights

- **Zero Setup Required**

    Thanks to Templ‚Äôs render: once, you no longer need to manually include GoasterCSS or GoasterJS in your templates. Styles and scripts are now automatically injected at compile time, simplifying usage and reducing boilerplate.

- **Asset Management with tempo**

    CSS and JavaScript are now managed and injected using [tempo](https://github.com/indaco/tempo), providing clean build-time control over component assets and simplifying future theming and customization.

- **Builder Pattern Support**

    A new `ToasterBuilder` has been introduced, offering a fluent, chainable API for configuring toast notifications in a more readable and expressive way.

This release also includes general refactors, improved test coverage, better CI workflows, and updated documentation. See the full changelog below for details. Below is the complete list of changes included in this release.
